# Implementation of PCA with ANN Algorithm for Face Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm for face recognition tasks. The PCA technique is utilized for dimensionality reduction, while the ANN is employed to classify the reduced feature set. The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in this repository.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the `dataset` folder. It consists of images of faces that will be processed to extract features using PCA before being fed into the ANN for classification.

## Requirements
To run this implementation, you will need the following Python packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your choice of ANN framework)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset from the `dataset` folder.
- Normalize the images to ensure uniformity in input data.

### 2. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the image data while retaining most of the variance.
- Select the number of principal components based on explained variance.

### 3. ANN Model Creation
- Define an ANN architecture suitable for classification tasks.
- Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.

### 4. Training the Model
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Train the ANN on the PCA-transformed training data.

### 5. Evaluation and Testing
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.

## Usage
To run the entire pipeline, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
